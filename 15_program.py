# Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

# Generate a noisy cosine wave using math.sin() and math.cos().

# Smooth the signal using:

# Your own implementation of Moving Average
# Your own implementation of Weighted Moving Average
# Plot the following on the same graph:

# Original noisy signal
# Moving average smoothed signal
# Weighted moving average smoothed signal
# Plot must include:

# Title
# Legend
# Grid
# Custom tick intervals on the axes
